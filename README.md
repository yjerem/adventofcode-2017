# Advent of Code 2017

My solutions to http://adventofcode.com/

Ruby is my language of choice for solving them as fast as possible, and I'm
putting those quick 'n' dirty solutions in the `ruby-dirty/` folder.

Then I'm going to try to write a nice clean C solution for each one, which I'll
be putting in the `c-pretty/` folder.
